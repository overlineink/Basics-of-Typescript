# What is Typescript?

Typescript is not an entire new language. Its a super for the Javascript, that means any valid Javascript code is also valid Typescript code. But typescript has additional features that not exists on Javascript supported on most browsers out there.

#### Strong Typing 
For example in Typescript we've this concept of Strong or Static typing. If you already working with languages like Java, C# (...) when we define a variable we need to specify the type of that variable, but in Typescript typing is optional we don't need to use this feature, but using this feature make our application more predictable and make more easy to debug 'em when something goes wrong.

#### Object-oriented features 
Typescript also brings quite of Object-oriented features that we've missed in Javascript for long time. We've concept  of classes, interfaces, constructures, access modifiers like public and private, filds, generics and so on! You gonna learn this in this session.

#### Compile-time errors 
And other benefit for using Typescript is that typescript can catch errors at compile-time instead of runtime. Of course not all kind of errors but a lot errors. To there is a compilation instead envolves, and when we compile our Typescript code we can catch this errors and fix 'em before deploy our application.

#### Great tooling 
And finaly another benefit of using Typescript is that we get access to some great tools out there. One thing that I personaly love about Typescript is the Intelisense that we get in our code editors. Again you gonna see that in this session.
So Typescript is a beautifull language and basicly is a superset of Javascript, so a valid Javascript code is also valid Typescript code.

The browsers out there they not understand Typescript, is very unlikely they are going to support 'em in the future. So we need to compile or more acurasly transpile our Typescript code into Javascript. So this is part of building application, whenever we build an application Typescript compiler kick in and transpile Typescript  code into Javascript that browser can understand.
